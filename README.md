# DearDiary

##objective

There are pepole who want to record there life in diary but they could not because they are really busy or  too lazy to pick up a pen and notebook but here we comes as AI tool to simply ask daily question on how was your moring ,any beutiful moment or a are you with meeting some who wiil be part of your life .

###  A twitter Post 
(An Ai assistant you can tilk to for keeping a personal history .It asks you question about life and over time the daily questions it asks are more usefule and personal questions.the output is effectively an autobiography All from 5miutes  daily natural conversations .I would pay 10$/month for this if i could sel host it (no way am i sending answer to these personal questions to your servers.))

##why An Ai

simply people are too lazy so what we will do is we will simply want there answer and we going to make a sentence just like how you write a diary uisng chatgpt behind the scence

## This will be self hosted

pepole do not want to know there someone read there lifes story so you can self hoast this application on (this could be debatable)

## do we create our own ai 

yes we will,  chatgpt is worst as we know it just output some kind of ai which can summarize thing in more human language but we will use chatgpt for source 

## What do your answer
